@ worked <2h in part 1

own comments
* probably expanding universe as in first part, won't work (let's try, it's easy)
--> naive approach, works with low distance, then OutOfMemoryException
* probably the calculation should be done when measuring distances (providing universes between)

own advice
* priority of operators! 
  expansions * (ExpansionFactor - 1) != expansions * ExpansionFactor - 1 

evaluation                part1 / part2
difficulty (1st glance):  ***+  / ****
real difficulty:          *+    / * (just index or previous added, redo the problem)
effort:                   **    / **
enjoy:                    **** (all worked at first try) / ****
