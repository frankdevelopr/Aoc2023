own comments
* count group position -> 2^n for combinations
  * when no group defined, how to break?
* Instead of regex not reused, try using groups (#+) and then get matches
* Brute force worked but too slow - all combinations tested, 18s of test execution
  * improved to 3s with parallel and some optimizations, but not enough for unfolded
  * FIND A HEURISTIC! or a good algorithm!

own advice
* 1st understand well the problem, start from easy examples

evaluation                part1 / part2
difficulty (1st glance):  ***** / ***** (redo the solution to avoid brute force)
real difficulty:          ** (brute force) /
effort:                   *** (code not cleaned up) /
enjoy:                    ** /
