1h or so for part 1

own comments
part 1
* find equal lines to search the center and the analyze the others
  * then if needed compare others to see if they in fact are mirrors

* happy though: reduce columns and rows to numbers, then much less operations to be done, right?
  * value for each column needs not not overlap, position is important for comparison

Values # = 1, . = 0, 2^n starting from left

#.##..##. e.g. -> 1 + 4 + 8 + 64 + 128 
..#.##.#.
##......#
for column, [0] = 1 + 4 = 5

part2
* the smudge should be just one digit or position so with current implementation I need to test for column and row values if p1 == p2 or |p1 - p2| = 2^n if so, equal them and proceed
  * note the smudge can be of non-consecutive lines but same distance from reflection line (fuck!)

I think I'm closer but probably there is problem on finding spot (for whatever reason), probably because of the update of values.
Analyze patterns were next == previous || next == 0.
Add more tests for finding spots and FixRows/FixColumns.

own advice
* is this idea reusable to other problems in Aoc? maybe the combinations one?

evaluation                part1 / part2
difficulty (1st glance):  *** (not sure if I understood the whole problem) / **** (probably easier with current solution)
real difficulty:          *+ (because of happy thought) / 
effort:                   * / 
enjoy:                    ***** /
