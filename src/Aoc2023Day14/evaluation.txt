* rocks need to move from position to other position most (north in this case)
  * i assume for part 2, it can be to other coordinates 
* for moving rocks, note that on each move, they add space to others and so on
  * maybe it can be optimized to avoid recalculating all lines again
* rocks only stop when found other rocks
* rocks # don't move but are stoppers
