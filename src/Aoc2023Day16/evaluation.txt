work log
several hours, 3 or 4 I estimate just for first part

own comments
* follow all paths (can be done in parallel when splitting)
* problem -> detect ends, there should be cycles, how to detect them easily
* calculation of reflection in each edge or mirror
* I'm proud it works on "first" attempt
* Using parallel again

own advice
* review arrays in c#, jagged and multidimensional or how create them
  * and how are they traversed
  * review IEnumerable<T>[][]
* code can be more consistent, tiles, coords used or not, [][] vs [,]
* reduce memory print?
* review string operations to remove chars etc
* review creation of layout

difficulty (1st glance):  ****  / ** (may it work with "brute" force? I think so, not so many combinations)
real difficulty:          ***   /
effort:                   ****  /
enjoy:                    ***** /
