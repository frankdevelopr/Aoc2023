in/out
* same problem in/out, how to find it easily? 
  * count walls or lines traversed? even or 0 out, odd in
  * but consider edges themselves, how they should be counted? as 1? avoid them?
* another approach
  * just find an easy point in (i.e. don't calculate all points if in or out), then fill in all directions, including diagonals
  * and stop if wall is found

dimensions/starting point
* since we can move in all directions, maybe we'd need to:
  1. find the size of the trench
  2. find the location of starting point so we can move always in (topmost and bottom most point)

* approach 2. grow dinamically (still using char[,])
