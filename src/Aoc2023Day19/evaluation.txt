462.000.000.000 out of 256.000.000.000.000 in 11:30h --> 265 days of calculation
1.000.000.000 every 2' at most 

* brute force won't work again, find another way, analyzing/reducing workflows

evaluation                part1 / part2
difficulty (1st glance):  ***+  / * or ******

enjoy:                    ***   /
