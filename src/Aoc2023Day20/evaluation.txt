@2h part1

own comments
* difficult to think how it should be processed
  * receive just add message to queue of processing
  * process send to others and process others (2 loops for ordering)

* doesn't work, need to review BFS
  * it is not process by level (in order) but in depth
  * add while loop in broadcaster and messages? should every module return its next modules?

own advice
* need to be very cautious with order, use queues?
