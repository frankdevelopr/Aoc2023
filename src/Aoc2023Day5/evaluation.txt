------------
wording was quite long this time... :/
just some conversions with same logic but for different purpose
part 1 worked at first attempt :O
some parts can be cleaned up or refactored a little
part2 it seems to much data in... takes really long :/
this should be optimized since with current implementation it needs to be executed 2.4 billions times, which in my computer take several minutes (in release mode)

6:05 minutes to calculate the whole thing (!) in release mode
with dirty parallel for (wrong implementation even getting good result) it took 1:58 seconds in release mode

advice
* investigate parallel.for
  * https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/msp-n-p/ff963547(v=pandp.10)
* find better solution, not so expensive in CPU terms (there should be a shortcut I assume)
* take into consideration long data
* be aware of indexes +1 -1, end conditions and so on

difficulty of part 1 at first glance *
difficulty of part 2 at first glance *

effor(part 2) ***** (lazy to find performant solution, moved to day 6)
