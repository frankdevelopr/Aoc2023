@18:30h - 20:15h (part 2)

own comments
* good move moving IComparable to IComparer (but should be done earlier)

own advice
* be consistent of usage of static in classes
* don't go WILD coding
* focus on details, don't trust input example data (less in AoC2003)
* refactor and commit in smaller steps
* make sure basic calculations are done well, before going further
  * in this case, full house calculation was wrong
* focus on changing parts, Hand classifier and Card value
