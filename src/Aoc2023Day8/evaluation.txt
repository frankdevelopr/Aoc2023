own comments
* read directions
* create "tree" if possible (missing nodes?)
  * or use dict of nodes node -> leftnode, rightnode (dict<string, node>)
* work on first attempt
* I think 2nd part is working ok but it's brute force algorithm that takes ages, taking a look at reddit it says to use LCM (Less Common Multiple to find the solution)

own advice
* don't know if I'm doing well TDD
* using small classes make code easy and quick

evaluation part1 / part2
